# Python Tools

A collection of Python tools that can make a C developer's life a little easier, published here under MIT license.

## cparser

Given a C file as input, this tool parses C syntax and outputs results to json. A useful script if you want to make a tool such as an editor or a code-simplification aid. Or a [Bitfieldiser](https://github.com/VaiaPatta1985/Bitfieldiser)!

## stringify

Barebones script that takes a text file and makes an altered copy with all the special characters escaped. A simplistic but useful tool for whenever you want to programmatically create a file.
